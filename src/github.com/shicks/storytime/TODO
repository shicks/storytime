1. receive emails?
2. kick/skip/ping/delete operations?
3. chat/text integration?
4. settings page (name, email (chat?) prefs, etc)


authentication issues:
 - would be nice to not require tying emails to a google account, since
   many people don't use their google account as their primary email
 - could use any story link as a login link after the part is written,
   but this is much less secure, and in particular, security leaks are
   completely uncontained.
 - alternately we could use a cookie (which is similarly insecure if it's
   not tied to something else, i.e. hashed with the ip address) or a URL,
   and we could allow invalidating sessions...
   - store creds for multiple IP addresses?
   - just make email parsing work?
